                    <p>Rahul Dravid, already recognised as one the world’s best ever batsmen, 
                        has been tipped to coach the Indian men’s team on a permanent basis.</p>
                    <p>Craig Wright, who is currently assistant coach for Scotland’s men’s team, 
                        captained Dravid for Scotland in 2003, and the Indian legend clearly made 
                        a lasting impression. Dravid scored 600 runs at an average of 66.66 in 11 
                        innings, but it was more than just his batting that Wright remembers</p>
                    <p>“On top of working with the national team players he did a lot of travelling 
                        around the country to do coaching events with kids – for someone of that 
                        stature to willingly invest the time and effort that he did was a testament 
                        to the man. It was no surprise to see him become a highly rated coach with 
                        the Indian U19 side, and I wouldn’t be at all shocked to see him as the India 
                        men’s head coach in the future.”</p>

                    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>“The way he would compile an innings was 
                        incredible. He’d get to 50 or 60 without seeming to play a shot then he’d 
                        step on the gas and smash it everywhere. He had a much more dynamic side to 
                        his batting than I think he was given credit for.”</em></p>
                    <p>Wright played 195 times for Scotland between 1997 and 2009, but he describes 
                        2003 as a particularly exciting time. Scotland’s entry into the English National 
                        League county competition meant an increased number of high quality fixtures, 
                        and a significant sponsorship deal with Lloyds TSB was announced around the same 
                        time that Dravid’s signature was secured.</p>
                    <p>“Several things came together to make it a bit of a golden period for the game in 
                        this country. I think my initial reaction was disbelief when it was suggested that 
                        we had a chance of signing someone like [Dravid], but obviously when it was confirmed 
                        there was a huge buzz”.</p>
                    <p>Scotland’s marquee man more than lived up to the hype. After a slow start in his 
                        first two games, 25 against Hampshire and a first-ball duck against a touring 
                        Pakistan side respectively, Dravid showed his class with two unbeaten hundreds 
                        in his next three knocks.</p>
                    <p>Wright recalls: “The way he would compile an innings was incredible. He’d get to 50 
                        or 60 without seeming to play a shot then he’d step on the gas and smash it everywhere. 
                        He had a much more dynamic side to his batting than I think he was given credit for.”</p>

                    <p>Those knocks did not yield any victories however, and despite his own brilliance, 
                        the innings that meant the most to Dravid came against Sussex, where he made 69 off 
                        79 balls, and put on 167 with Jon Kent as Scotland won by 6 wickets.</p>
                    <p>“It took us a while to get a win after he arrived, and he was really frustrated by that. 
                        His performances were magnificent, but unfortunately the rest of the team struggled to 
                        maintain our levels of performance – his joy when we did finally win a game was so genuine 
                        it was great to see.”</p>
                    <p>Indeed, it was his professionalism and unerring will to win that set him apart as something 
                        special throughout his playing career. The talent and the ability to score runs was evident, 
                        but what differentiates great batsmen from good batsmen is mental fortitude – prizing your 
                        wicket innings after innings, and steadfastly refusing to give it away. </p>
                    <p>Dravid had that in spades, as demonstrated not only by his success for India but the continuous 
                        nature of it. In the 2003/04 season, immediately after his spell in Scotland, he averaged 95.46 
                        in Tests, and went on to play international cricket for almost another decade. Only four men in 
                        history have played more Test matches than him (164), and only three have scored more Test runs 
                        (13,288).</p>
                    <p>“It was evident straight away what a driven and determined guy he was”, Wright says. “A quiet, 
                        humble man with strong values. It was no surprise at all to see him go on and become the number one 
                        batsman in the world.” </p>
                    <p>For those of you thinking that Dravid can do no wrong, fear not – his stint in Scotland was not entirely 
                        flawless. “One of the first things I had to do after I’d met him was show him how to work the washing machine 
                        in the flat where he was staying,” Wright remembers. “We took him to play some golf as well, but his ball 
                        striking skills did not translate to the golf course – his driving left a bit to be desired! So he’s not perfect!”</p>
                    <p>It was his cricket rather than his golf that will live long in the memory however, and despite Dravid’s short stay in 
                        Scotland, his legacy is secure. Wright told me: “Scotland have been fortunate to have many top international players 
                        representing the team as the overseas player in county games, but Dravid I’m sure would rank right at the top of the 
                        list both on and off the field.”</p>
