                <h1>Mr Mitre - Bill Polson: A life in Scottish cricket</h1>

                    <p>Most cricket clubs across Scotland, and indeed the cricket-playing world, 
                        have stalwarts, figures who make cricket clubs what they are – men and 
                        women who have been part of the furniture for decades. They make up the 
                        very fabric of their club, lending advice, supportive or not, to future 
                        generations.</p>
                    <p>Few however will have made as big a contribution as Edinburgh South’s 
                        (previously Mitre) Bill Polson. Now 80, Bill has been involved with the 
                        club in every imaginable capacity: President, secretary, captain, coach, 
                        umpire, and now youth convenor and scorer.</p>
                    <p>Jim Brims, ESCC’s current President, began playing for Mitre in 1977 and 
                        knew Bill long before then. Jim says: “I would say unequivocally that 
                        without Bill there would not be a club today. Going back over the years, 
                        anyone [that has been] involved think of him as ‘Mr Mitre’.”</p>

                    <p><strong>How a chance sighting and tales of Bradman started a cricketing obsession:</strong></p>
                    <p>Bill’s lifelong love of cricket began almost by chance in the summer of 1948, 
                        when both a family walk along the leafy Grange area of Edinburgh, and the 
                        success of the touring Australians in England sparked an interest.</p>
                    <p>Bill remembers: “I was out with my parents and we passed the Carlton CC 
                        ground – I was intrigued by this game which appeared to be played by 
                        men halfway up a hill. Around the same time, a cousin of mine who’d been 
                        stationed in Australia during the war married an Australian girl. I was 
                        hearing dispatches on the radio about Bradman, and wondering why this 
                        country so far away which had provided a wife for my cousin was quite so 
                        good at cricket.”</p>
                    <img class="image" src="assets/images/inch-park.jpeg">
                    <p>Bill began going to watch Carlton regularly, and his memories of that side 
                        are crystal clear – Scottish cricketers who evidently left a lasting imprint 
                        on an impressionable mind. “Carlton had an opening bowling attack, Tom 
                        Sommerville, who was a music teacher, and Ian Scott, who played piano in a 
                        dance band. They took a lot of wickets – at least one of them would take five 
                        wickets, and some weeks they both would – they were my early heroes.” His eyes 
                        also lit up when describing Carlton’s opening batsmen, James Aitchison and 
                        Bill Ellis, both Scotland internationals. Aitchison was undoubtedly the prominent 
                        Scottish batsman of the post-war period, scoring 56 hundreds in club cricket 
                        for Grange, Carlton and Kilmarnock, in addition to scoring 3,669 runs for Scotland.</p>
                    <p><strong>A playing career that spanned seven decades:</strong></p>
                    <br>
                    <h4><em>"I remember waving the trophy around in a chip shop in Carrick Knowe"</em></h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>Bill first played for Carlton’s second XI at the age of 14, but after a few 
                        seasons found himself regarded as more of a scorer than a player and felt 
                        the need to move on. Bill started playing for Mitre, then a nomadic public 
                        parks side, in 1957, and retired more than half a century later in 2014, 
                        only when forcefully told to by both his family and doctor.</p>
                    <p>Despite, by his own admission, not being the greatest cricketer, he took well 
                        over 500 wickets and scored nearly 2,500 runs for Mitre and Edinburgh South. 
                        When asked about specific moments that stood out, he did not hesitate: “The 
                        big personal one was when I batted for around 30 overs in a game to ensure we 
                        avoided relegation. That was in 1979 – our first season in the East of Scotland 
                        League Division 4. The game for Mitre as a club would be winning the Parks 
                        Trophy final in 1981, which was played in the rain at Corstorphine – I remember 
                        waving the trophy around in a chip shop in Carrick Knowe!”</p>

                    <p><strong>Inspiring future generations:</strong></p>
                    <p>As well as guiding Mitre and South through various peaks and troughs in all his 
                        roles over the years, Bill also found time to be the junior coaching convenor 
                        for ESCA from 1989 until just over four years ago. Not only has he helped 
                        develop talent at his own cricket club, he shared his love of the game with 
                        young cricketers across Scotland. “I’ve seen all sorts of people come through 
                        that have gone on to greater things”, he says. “Ally Evans playing for Scotland 
                        would be a good example.”</p>
                    <p><strong>Brushing shoulders with the great and the good:</strong></p>
                    <p>Furthermore, Bill has found time to watch and support the Scotland national team 
                        across the country in his time, but surely the most memorable experience came in 
                        1997 when he travelled to Malaysia. Competing in the ICC trophy, Scotland qualified 
                        for the ’99 World Cup in England, after beating Ireland in the third-place play-off, 
                        and the additional attention on Scotland brought an unexpected opportunity.</p>
                    <p>“Keith Graham, the BBC correspondent got busier and busier as the tournament went 
                        on and Scotland began to do well”, Bill recalls. “He’d been spotting in the Sky 
                        box on Scotland players, but he got so busy that he deputised me to go and say 
                        ‘that’s Kevin Thomson or Mike Smith’ – I was sat with folk like Ian Smith and 
                        Harsha Bhogle, who were both extremely nice.”</p>
                    <p>Most stalwarts are known within their own club, content to pass judgement from 
                        the boundary and relive former glories. Few remain actively involved in the running 
                        of their own club, and so for Bill to still do what he does not just for Edinburgh 
                        South, but also for ESCA is testament to the man. Bill Polson has already played a 
                        fine innings, but it is far from over.</p>
