                <p>Calum MacLeod is one of Scotland’s most prominent cricketers.
                   Nominated in 2020 for the Associate Men’s Cricketer of the 
                   Decade Award, MacLeod averages 36.48 with the bat in 68 ODI’s 
                   and has made 8 hundreds. I spoke to him about what the sport 
                   means to him, Scotland’s win over England in 2018 when he scored 
                   140 not out, and his thoughts ahead of this year’s T20 World Cup.</p>
                <p><strong><em>How did you get into cricket Calum? What are your 
                    memories of playing growing up?</em></strong></p>
                <p>I grew up at Drumpellier cricket club just outside of Glasgow. 
                    My dad was a social member there, and me and my two brothers 
                    just used to go along. Mum and Dad would go down and socialise; 
                    we’d go down into the nets or onto the grass, just make games up 
                    and play cricket all summer. The first game of cricket I ever 
                    played was for my brother's team. They were a player short and I 
                    got dragged along – I just fielded and ever since then I just 
                    wanted to play. I was hooked by it from the very first time – I 
                    didn't bat, I didn't bowl, but just enjoyed it and wanted to play 
                    every opportunity. There’s just something about the game. You seem 
                    to fail more than you do well, no matter what level you’re at, but 
                    when you’re in that moment of doing well, whether it’s an U11 game or 
                    playing for Scotland, the emotions are almost the same.</p>
                <img class="image" src="assets/images/pro-game.jpg" alt="A game of cricket">
                <p style="text-align:center"><em>"The clubs I’ve enjoyed the most have been real “club clubs” if 
                    that makes sense – it’s coming back and finding out how the 2nds or 
                    the 3rds have got on; it’s winning on a Saturday and enjoying a beer 
                    in the clubhouse."</em></p>
                <p><strong><em>With the past 18 months or so, has your relationship with 
                    cricket changed given the circumstances?</em></strong></p>
                <p>As a national team, it’s been really challenging – we’ve played two games 
                    of cricket in 18 months, which just isn’t enough. The associate game has 
                    issues to get cricket on at the best of times with the finances involved, 
                    before you add in a pandemic. The love of the game is still there, you’re 
                    just waiting. Any opportunity throughout the lockdown to watch any of the 
                    cricket that was on, I did and just wished it was us. Even watching and 
                    learning – watching Joe Root play in the subcontinent, the way he was going 
                    about his innings, some of the things that worked for him and didn't for 
                    others. I think that probably kept me going actually, the cricket and live 
                    sport. The teams that were able to get it on were not only lucky to be playing, 
                    it was lucky for all of us the rest of us that we were able to watch the game 
                    that we all enjoy.</p>
                <p><strong><em>It was certainly an escape for me. You’ve gone back to cricket 
                    obviously this summer in Kent, for the county side and your club team 
                    Lordswood. Do you notice differences between club cricket north and 
                    south of the border?</em></strong></p>
                <p>I don’t think between the top sides. The top sides in Scotland would be a top 
                    side anywhere – if you took the current Heriots side or the Grange side of the 
                    past few years, they’re made up of quite a lot of international cricketers, 
                    recently retired internationals or aspiring international players who are in 
                    the age group systems. Where I see the biggest difference is the depth, just 
                    because more people play cricket down here, so as you go down the leagues the 
                    standard tends to be higher. Whenever I’ve gone back and played in Scotland I’ve 
                    always thoroughly enjoyed it – it’s always played at quite a good tempo, quite 
                    a good competitiveness. The clubs I’ve enjoyed the most have been real “club clubs” 
                    if that makes sense – it’s coming back and finding out how the 2nds or the 3rds 
                    have got on; it’s winning on a Saturday and enjoying a beer in the clubhouse with 
                    some of the members who have come down to watch. That sense of community, 
                    especially with some of the cricket that we’re lucky enough to play as 
                    internationals, where it’s really high pressure. In some associate tournaments, 
                    you know if you don’t qualify your chance to play in a World Cup aren't there, 
                    or if you do really badly you might be losing your contract. So to go back to club
                     cricket on a Saturday where there’s eleven guys who are there because they want 
                     to enjoy something, it’s refreshing to take a bit of the competitive pressure off,
                      even though you still want to play well.</p>
                <p><strong><em>[That picture] over your right shoulder, nicely positioned on the wall, 
                    is what I want to talk about next - that game against England in 2018.</em></strong></p>
                <p>I’d like to say that was intentional, but my seven-month old son was having a moment where 
                    I usually do the calls, so I’ve been relegated to the garage! That was a birthday gift 
                    from my brothers, they got it framed up for me – it’s the only cricket thing I’ve got up 
                    in the house.</p>
                <p><strong><em>It’s not a bad one to have I guess?</em></strong></p>
                <p>No, it does make me smile every time I see it.</p>
                <p style="text-align:center"><em>"I can't remember seeing many pitch invasions in Scottish sport let alone in 
                    Scottish cricket. The noise, the emotion, the sound of the game and the winning 
                    moment – I can still hear it now."</em></p>
                <p><strong><em>Going into that game, you’ve spoken about pressurised settings, playing 
                    at The Grange, a familiar setting – was there pressure on you at all?</em></strong></p>
                <p>It’s not often we get, not a free game, but just a game where playing with as much 
                    freedom as you can isn’t going to have a consequence. If I equate it to some of 
                    the top teams, England, India and Australia were regularly scoring 350 in the 
                    games leading into the World Cup, but in the tournament itself the scores were 
                    much lower. I think that’s because of the amount of cricket that they play where 
                    they can just play carefree cricket, because there’s no end consequence. That was 
                    something we took into playing England – we’d spoken about being this fearless team, 
                    who really put pressure back onto bowlers, and we’d spoken about beating teams when 
                    they were at their best. You didn't want them to turn up and play badly. A lot of 
                    what we did was to be aggressive, be dynamic, target powerplays, go after bowlers 
                    and not let teams settle. Getting that opportunity to play a team like England, who 
                    were number 1 at the time, I always felt they’re one of the teams that don’t want 
                    to expand cricket when they have the opportunity to bring more associates into World 
                    Cups – I think it was just at the right time we played them.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Obviously, it’s all well and good having that mindset, but you need to go 
                    and execute it. You walking out to bat with the base that Kyle [Coetzer] and Matthew 
                    [Cross] provided, must have given you the license to go and play the innings that you 
                    did?</em></strong></p>
                <p>One of the things that Scottish cricket will always be indebted to Kyle for is that 
                    it’s one thing as a captain to say “go and play like that”, but for him to lead from 
                    the front, be our most experienced batter, makes it easier for the rest of us to follow. 
                    If you’re batting at 3, walking out at 100-1 off ten or eleven overs, it’s a nice platform. 
                    It gives you a chance to get in a little bit before you realise how good the wicket is 
                    and that 350 is going to be a par score. I don't think you’d find many batters not happy 
                    to walk out at 100-1.</p>
                <img class="image" src="assets/images/cross-bat.jpeg" alt="batsmen">
                <p><strong><em>Did you have game plans for specific bowlers? Sweeping the spinners Ali 
                    and Rashid was a big feature of your innings.</em></strong></p>
                <p>We’re quite individual in terms of game plans. I’m not going to try to bat like Crossy or 
                    George Munsey. We get sent all the footage of the bowlers and then it’s up to you to think 
                    how you’re going to play against them. Sweeping at The Grange, with the nature of the pitch 
                    and with the stands in, it can be quite short square and a good area to target. That was a 
                    definite focus for me leading into the game, but against the seamers it didn’t vary much 
                    from what I’d normally do.</p>
                <p><strong><em>What are your memories of reaching three figures, and then walking off the Grange 
                    unbeaten at the end?</em></strong></p>
                <p>I remember feeling happy, and a wave of excitement getting 3 figures. I don't know 
                    whether it was because I was in the mythical “zone”, but when I think about that 
                    day, it's not the biggest wave of emotion that I get or the memory that gives me 
                    the most goosebumps. They’re much later on in the day, even after the game – things 
                    that I remember after the game or the winning moment. I think that's more where the 
                    emotion takes over, because you're not in control of it. You are in control of your 
                    batting, so yes you're delighted, yes you're happy, you can take your helmet off and 
                    celebrate it and it is a wonderful moment, but it's not where the emotions take over 
                    that you can't control. </p>
                <img class="image" src="assets/images/Calum-MacLeod-2.jpeg" atl="Callum MacLeod">
                <p><strong><em>When Safyaan [Sharif] took that wicket though, you watch the footage, and 
                    there was a real release - what was the aftermath like?</em></strong></p>
                <p>That's the moment that I think cricket in Scotland can capture.  I think it's a sleeping 
                    giant of a sport in the country. The amount of cricket and the amount of clubs that you 
                    can find up there, and the passion that's in the game. I can't remember seeing many pitch 
                    invasions in Scottish sport let alone in Scottish cricket. The noise, the emotion, the 
                    sound of the game and the winning moment – I can still hear it now. I remember people 
                    running on, people I played cricket against when I was younger, people I haven't seen in 
                    years just on this pitch, random people, people that you don't know with their top off 
                    celebrating and jumping on you. That sort of passion for the game, and yes maybe part of 
                    it was beating England, which as a Scottish team is always going to be a big moment, but 
                    it also shows that it meant a lot more than just the 11 guys and the coaching staff that 
                    were there playing, and I think that's the moment that I will always remember most fondly.</p>
                <img class="image" src="assets/images/callum.jpeg" alt="Callum Celebrating">
                <p style="text-align:center"><em>"The ICC has spent a lot of money, time and effort improving the associate game, but 
                    then it’s harder to get into the World Cups. It's always been, 'well the games aren't 
                    competitive', but then they make the teams competitive and say, 'you can't play anymore'."</em></p>
                <p><strong><em>With a World Cup just around the corner, is there then a desire to have that 
                    sort of success on a big stage again?</em></strong></p>
                <p>100% right. Obviously with the pandemic we haven't played as much cricket as we’d like to. 
                    We played Afghanistan in Sri Lanka in 2019 and had opportunities to beat them, but this 
                    squad, the guys want to get out there and challenge ourselves to get through to the group 
                    stage and we want to go and take more scalps and beat more full members and show the 
                    standard of associate cricket, because I really believe that if it's not us winning games 
                    it'll be one of the other top Associates. I think the level of associate cricket is that 
                    high now. We want to get out there – we don't want to be the team who beat England or 
                    Zimbabwe, but then never did it at a World Cup. We want to attempt to do something special 
                    there. We got over that hurdle of beating the full members, now let's go do it in a 
                    tournament, let's go make more memories, let's have more games to talk about, and more 
                    things to keep building the game in Scotland.</p>
                <p><strong><em>In terms of the Scotland squad itself, is there anyone to look out for that can 
                    make a real impact?</em></strong></p>
                <p>I look at our potential batting line-up, the squad still yet to be picked, but you watch 
                    the way some of the guys have played this year. George [Munsey] has done well with his 
                    opportunities at Kent, Matthew Cross has already got a couple of double hundreds this 
                    year, Kyle it's clear to see what I think of Kyle, Berro [Richard Berrington] just seems 
                    to be getting better with age and then a guy like Ollie Hairs who's been blowing teams 
                    away, it will be exciting to see that batting unit hopefully flying. Then the bowlers, 
                    I don't envy Shane [Burger] and Kyle's job – there must be 8, 10, maybe 12 bowlers who 
                    they'll need to narrow down and I think genuinely all 10 or 12 could make a genuine case 
                    to go to this world cup, which is hugely exciting for Scottish cricket. They're all guys 
                    who can bowl fast, can bowl a bumper if they want. They've got skills – it's not made up 
                    of the traditional Scottish bowlers who have the keeper up and try to hit the stumps – 
                    it's made up of guys who can push batters back. To have that sort of battery there, whatever 
                    four or five or six, however many they take. I think that will be hopefully one of our 
                    strengths as well alongside our two left arm spinners who are both brilliant. </p>
                <p><strong><em>It’s a real shame that they’ve cut the number of teams at tournaments when 
                    you see the depth of talent there.</em></strong></p>
                <p>It's so frustrating. I've been lucky enough to play associate cricket for 13 or 14 years 
                    now and I don't remember the standard ever being quite so high. Maybe when Scotland and 
                    Ireland were the top 2 teams in the early 2000s, possibly those two teams, but the 
                    all-around standard now, whether it's Papua New Guinea, Holland, Oman are a terrific 
                    team, the standard of the whole associate game has improved. It's kind of counterproductive 
                    that the ICC has spent a lot of money, time and effort improving the associate game – the 
                    current associate fixture list without Covid is probably as good as it ever has been and 
                    that's promoting the game a lot better, but then it’s harder to get into the World Cups. 
                    It's always been, “well the games aren't competitive”, but then they make the teams 
                    competitive and say, “you can't play anymore”, but sadly I don't think it's something I'll 
                    be able to solve.</p>
                <p><strong><em>It's difficult to compare countries, but you only have to look at Afghanistan to 
                    see what happens when you give smaller nations a platform. With the talent there it's 
                    inevitable.</em></strong></p>
                <p>That's why we're desperate to do well in this world cup. Ireland's success, Afghanistan's 
                    success was built off the back of doing well at world cups and it's where people sit up 
                    and take notice. That's what we want to do as a squad. We want to go and win games at World 
                    Cups, so it’s not just the audience in Scotland who sit up and watch us.</p>
